# MMDVM Software Stack
This repo contains software that has been built on Pi-Star 3.x and 4.1.x.

The README.md in each branch will guide you on what each build requires.

The binaries are compiled using the sources available from here: https://github.com/g4klx and here: https://github.com/juribeparada

New binaries are compiled and pushed to git once per day *if* the source repositories are changed.

**Note: Pull requests will never be accepted directly to this repository, the binaries are build from the above sources, if you want to change the binaries here, post your changes to the upstream sources.
