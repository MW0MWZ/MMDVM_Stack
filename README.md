# MMDVM Software Stack
This repo contains software that has been built on multiple platforms, specifically to run on Alpine Linux and RasPiOS.
It can be used in docker, or directly on Alpine Linux or Raspberry Pi hosts.

The README.md in each branch will guide you on what each build requires.

The binaries are compiled using the sources available from here: https://github.com/g4klx and here: https://github.com/juribeparada

New binaryies are compiled and pushed to git once per day *if* the source repositories are changed.
